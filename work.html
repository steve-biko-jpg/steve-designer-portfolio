                        <h4>Case Study: The Green Academy Rebrand</h4>
                        <img src="branding-case-study.jpg" alt="Green Academy Branding Project" class="case-study-image">
                        <p class="case-study-problem">
                            <strong>Problem:</strong> The Green Academy had a dated logo and inconsistent branding that didn't reflect their modern, eco-friendly curriculum. This was leading to low enrollment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="case-study-solution">
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> I developed a new, vibrant logo and a comprehensive brand guide. We introduced a fresh color palette and typography, applied across their website, brochures, and social media. The result was a 30% increase in inquiries and a renewed sense of pride within the school community.

                        <h4>Case Study: St. Mark's School Social Media Growth</h4>
                        <img src="digital-marketing-case-study.jpg" alt="St. Mark's Social Media Campaign" class="case-study-image">
                        <p class="case-study-problem">
                            <strong>Problem:</strong> St. Mark's School wanted to boost their community engagement and attract prospective parents on social media, but their content lacked a cohesive strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="case-study-solution">
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> We created a targeted social media campaign focusing on student success stories and behind-the-scenes school life. I designed engaging graphics and a content calendar, leading to a 50% increase in follower count and a significant jump in post interactions.

                        <h4>Case Study: Brookwood College Annual Report</h4>
                        <img src="graphic-design-case-study.jpg" alt="Brookwood College Annual Report Design" class="case-study-image">
                        <p class="case-study-problem">
                            <strong>Problem:</strong> Brookwood College's annual report was text-heavy and unappealing, making it difficult to convey key achievements to donors and stakeholders.
                        </p>
                        <p class="case-study-solution">
                            <strong>Solution:</strong> I transformed the report into a visually stunning, easy-to-read document. By using clean infographics, bold typography, and strategic photo layouts, the report became a powerful tool for showcasing their accomplishments and securing further funding.
